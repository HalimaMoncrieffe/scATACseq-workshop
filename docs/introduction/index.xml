      <description>Rstudio offers a graphical interface to facilitate the interaction between a user and an underlying programming language (this is sometimes called IDE, or integrated development environment). It can be very useful when a user is not necessarily proficent with command line-based computing. However, such graphical interfaces are not always able to connect to services such as AWS.
Since most of the analyses we will conduct will be done on AWS, we&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to use Rtudio directly from there.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Unix and the R scripting language.
 If a refresher is needed for Unix command line (hopefully not), please go over this tutorial and its companion cheatsheet . Getting down to basics: an introduction to the fundamentals of R (courtesy of Mark Ravinet ). Gentle introduction to R/Biocondutor: here  For a full in-depth guide of Bioconductor ecosystem: read the comprehensive R/Bioconductor book from Kasper D.</description>
