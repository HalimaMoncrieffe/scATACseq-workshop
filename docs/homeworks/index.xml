      <description>Goals  Process bulk ATAC-seq for PBMCs (GSE111013), perform QCs and compare them to the bulk ATAC-seq QCs seen during demonstration session 1   We recommend focusing on few datasets from healthy donors, e.g. SRR6762787, SRR6762790 and SRR6762793.
 Split bam file from human 5,000 PBMCs scATACseq into bams / cell type using sinto   Processed data can be obtained directly from 10X Genomics   Make some celltype-specific pseudo-bulk bigwig tracks</description>

      <description>Goals  Import counts from mouse E18 brain scATACseq (5K) (provided by 10X Genomics) in R and process them   Processed data for mouse E18 brain scATACseq can be obtained directly from 10X Genomics   Compare Signac processing and SingleCellExperiment processing
  Transfer annotations from mouse E18 brain scRNAseq (5K) to mouse E18 brain scATACseq
   Processed data for mouse E18 brain scRNAseq can be obtained directly from 10X Genomics  Find genes associated to DA peaks and run GO over-enrichment / gene set enrichment analysis  1.</description>

      <description>Goals   Import, filter, normalize and cluster cells from the T-cell exhaustion dataset
  Run chromVAR to identify TF activity in each cell cluster
  Using knowledge on TFs used in different cell types, suggest cell cluster annotation of the dataset
  Confirm this by computing gene activity scores and check known markers
  Integrate scRNAseq and scATACseq to validate cluster annotations
