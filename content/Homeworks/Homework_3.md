## Goals

1. Import, filter, normalize and cluster cells from the T-cell exhaustion dataset  

2. Run chromVAR to identify TF activity in each cell cluster  

3. Using knowledge on TFs used in different cell types, suggest cell cluster annotation of the dataset  

4. Confirm this by computing gene activity scores and check known markers  

5. Integrate scRNAseq and scATACseq to validate cluster annotations
